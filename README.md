# Movie Buff
Movie Buff is a movie-themed quiz game inspired by Jeopardy! 

## Motivation  
I wanted to make this game becuase my family and I watch Jeopardy! together regularly, and my favorite categories are those related to film and tv. I took design inspiration from the old fashioned marquee at the movie theater in my town in addition to the originial Jeopardy! game board.
